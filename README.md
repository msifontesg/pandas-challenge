# pandas-challenge
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.


Math Scores by Grade
Performed the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
